description: 'We used high-density Neuropixels probes in two awake monkeys (one female
  and one male) to characterize the shape and texture tuning of dozens of neurons
  simultaneously. The shape set included 15 simple geometric shapes each presented
  at eight different rotations in 45Â° increments, resulting in a total of 120 shape
  stimuli. Shapes were filled with a uniform color, either darker or brighter than
  the background luminance. The texture stimulus set was composed of 40 naturalistic
  grayscale textures. Each texture image was presented in three versions: original,
  contrast-reversed, or spectrally-matched noise
