description: "This dataset contains multiunit threshold crossings, spiking band power,
  and behavioral data from a macaque performing a self-paced finger movement task,
  across 6 experimental sessions spanning 2.5 years. The dataset may be useful in
  evaluating the stability of decoding algorithms across long time frames.\n\n96 channels
  of neural activity was recorded from Utah microelectrode arrays implanted in the
  motor cortex (M1). The positions & velocities of the index finger and middle-ring-small
  fingers were recorded using a manipulandum, where positions were normalized between
  full flexion and full extension. The experimental task was to move the two finger
  groups to acquire targets cued on a screen. \n\nEach day has 375 trials of center-out
  targets (trials alternating between the targets at a non-center location and then
  both targets at center), and 375 trials of random targets (target position for each
  finger chosen randomly at each trial, with a maximum flexion difference between
  fingers of 50%).\n\nExample code with an interactive GUI to visualize the data:

  setup can be found in Nason et al. 2021, Neuron  (DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2021.08.009)"
