description: "This dataset contains multiunit spiking times and behavioral data from
  a macaque in a finger movement task. The experimental task was to move two finger
  groups according to targets cued on a screen. Neural activity was recorded from
  electrode arrays implanted in primary motor cortex (M1). Finger positions as recorded
  by the manipulandum state, and normalized between full flexion and full extension,
  are provided. \n\nThis dataset is part of the FALCON benchmark: https://snel-repo.github.io/falcon.
  The datafile contains the following data in the acquisition fields: 2D kinematics
  (`finger_vel`) and metadata for FALCON evaluation (`eval_mask`). The datafile also
  contains multi-unit spiking activity in the `units` field.\n\nAs part of the FALCON
  challenge, dataset files are released in three ways. The held-in-calib data includes
  many trials of data intended for calibration of decoders in the FALCON challenge.
  The held-in-minival data is a small subset of the held-in-calib data intended for
  FALCON models to validate submission format. Lastly, held-out-calib data are separate
  sessions of data from held-in-calib, but have much fewer trials, intended to be
  used for few-shot recalibration. Please bear in mind these factors if making use
  of this dataset for purposes outside of the FALCON Benchmark. Each dataset split
  is considered one \"subject\" by the DANDI repository; only data from one monkey
  is included."
