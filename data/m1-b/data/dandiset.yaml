description: "This dataset contains multiunit spiking times and behavioral data from
  a macaque performing a reach-to-grasp task. The experimental task was a center-out
  reaching task with four different objects in eight possible positions. Neural activity
  was recorded from electrode arrays implanted in primary motor cortex (M1). Electromyographical
  (EMG) activity was simultaneously recorded from upper limb muscles. Provided as
  part of the FALCON Benchmark: https://snel-repo.github.io/falcon/ \n\nThe datafile
  contains the following data in the acquisition fields: `preprocessed_emg` containing
  iEMG recordings from 16 muscles and `eval_mask` indicating within-trial periods
  used for evaluating performance in the FALCON Benchmark. Each datafile also includes
  spike times in the `units` field, and trial metadata for each reach and grasp (`gocue_time`,
  `move_onset_time`, `contact_time`, `reward_time`, `result`, `number`, `tgt_loc`,
  `tgt_obj`, `obj_id`, `condition_id`) in the `trials` field.\n\nAs part of the FALCON
  challenge, dataset files are released in three ways. The `held-in-calib` data includes
  many trials of data intended for calibration of decoders in the FALCON challenge.
  The `held-in-minival` data is a small subset of the `held-in-calib` data intended
  for FALCON models to validate submission format. Lastly, `held-out-calib` data are
  separate sessions of data from `held-in-calib`, but have much fewer trials, intended
  to be used for few-shot recalibration. Please bear in mind these factors if making
  use of this dataset for purposes outside of the FALCON Benchmark. Each dataset split
  is considered one \"subject\" by the DANDI repository; only data from one monkey
  is included.\n\nData from an additional monkey is available here: https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000941"
