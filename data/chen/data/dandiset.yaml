description: We use our experiences to form and update beliefs about the hidden 
  states of the world. When possible, we also gather evidence by observing 
  others. However, how the brain integrates experiential and observational 
  evidence is not understood. We studied the dynamics of evidence integration in
  a two-player game with volatile hidden states. Both humans and monkeys 
  successfully updated their beliefs while playing the game and observing their 
  partner, though less effectively when observing. Electrophysiological 
  recordings in animals revealed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 
  integrates independent sources of experiential and observational evidence into
  a coherent neural representation of dynamic belief about the environment’s 
  state. The geometry of population activity revealed the computational 
  architecture of this integration and provided a neural account of the 
  behavioral asymmetry between experiential and observational evidence 
  accumulation. This work lays the groundwork for understanding the neural 
  mechanisms underlying evidence accumulation in social contexts within the 
  primate brain.
