description: 'The dataset contains neural activity from a period of open loop calibration
  from a human participant with an intracortical brain computer interface. This data
  was collected under an Investigational

  Device Exemption from the Food and Drug Administration and approved by the Institutional
  Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), registered
  at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01894802). The clinical trial is an early feasibility
  study with a primary outcome of evaluating the safety of an intracortical brain–computer
  interface for long-term neural recording and stimulation. Data was recorded from
  two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays in the hand "knob" area . The 7DoF
  are: 3D endpoint translation (x,y,z) 1D orientation (roll), and 3D grasp (flex/ext
  of thumb, index, ring, flex/ext of ring/pinky, thumb abduction).

  On each trial, audiovisual cues indicated to the participant to attempt a particular
  reach or grasp involving a combination of the listed degrees of freedom.


  This dataset is part of the FALCON benchmark: https://snel-repo.github.io/falcon.
  The datafile contains the following data in the acquisition fields: 7D kinematics
  (`OpenLoopKinematics`), trial numbers (`TrialNum`), and metadata for FALCON evaluation
  (`eval_mask`, `Blacklist`). The datafile also contains multi-unit spiking activity
  in the `units` field.


  As part of the FALCON challenge, dataset files are released in three ways. The held-in-calib
  data includes many trials of data intended for calibration of decoders in the FALCON
  challenge. The held-in-minival data is a small subset of the held-in-calib data
  intended for FALCON models to validate submission format. Lastly, held-out-calib
  data are separate sessions of data from held-in-calib, but have much fewer trials,
  intended to be used for few-shot recalibration. Please bear in mind these factors
  if making use of this dataset for purposes outside of the FALCON Benchmark. Each
  dataset split is considered one "subject" by the DANDI repository; only data from
  one iBCI participant is included.


  By downloading this dataset, you are agreeing to terms of the following Data Use
  Agreement:

  - I will receive access to de-identified data and will not attempt to establish
  the identity of or attempt to contact any of the subjects.

  - I will not attempt to make direct contact with PIs, affiliated data partner PIs,
  or staff at sites concerning the specific results of individual subjects. Data partner
  PIs may be contacted about potential collaboration opportunities.

  - I will not further disclose these data beyond the uses outlined in this agreement
  and my data use application and understand that redistribution of data in any manner
  is prohibited.

  - I will require anyone on my team who utilizes these data or anyone with whom I
  share these data to comply with this Data Use Agreement.
